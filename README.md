## Information Architecture

My midterm project saw me explore a sport that I am very passionate about; The High Jump. It was my desire to enlighten the audience about the History, of the sport, some of the rules, and then finally the important training required to succeed in the sport. As a current high Jumper on the University's track and Field team, I decided that I would do my best to reflect some of my insights into the sport, whilst channeling some of my heroes.

For the home page,I decided to go with an action shot of a high jumper as the background, with a high jump logo, a webpage title, and some hyperlinks to the second page, as well as a Wikipedia page.

To keep the user interested, I went with the Faster Pace font at the center of the homepage in order to add to the sport like effect.

I have a hyper link prompting the user to clcik if the want to know more about the sport. On the  following page, I start of with an intro about the sport.

Then they are introduced to the rules of the sport, followed by a history of the techniques and how the sport has evolved. I then finished it up with a the importance that training has to the sucess of a high jumper. As an athlete I understand that much and felt it was important to adress that.


## Design

First of all, I wanted to depict the thrill associated with high jump. So for the home page, I went with an action shot of a High Jumper. 

The home page of the website had a Z-Pattern. For this I chose a picture of myself clearing a height at a track meet held at RIT earlier this semester. The picture had an almost sepia (golden) undertone to it, so I wanted to make sure the fonts and logos chosen matched. At the center, I went with a  message using the Faster One google font. It had a fast sporty edge to it, thus adding to the thrill and overall aesthethic of the page, and I made the font black with a white shadow to improve the readability. Readers would also notice a quote at the bottom left of the screen before seeing the  final hyperlink at the extreme bottom right, Thus completing the z-pattern.

With the texts at the corners of the page, I went with the Bungee Inline font becasue it also had an edgy feel to it, which i felt worked with the overall aestthetic of the page.

It was also because of the clarity of this font that I decided to use it as the font for the headings and subheadings on the page. The body of the website however was written in Open Sans. I chose this because when I selected the Bungee Font, it was also suggested by google, and its clean crisp style works with the overall aesthetic of the webpage.

Here, I went with an F-pattern layout. With the High Jump Logo, and the sign up form at the top left and right respectively. The header also had a picture of derek drouin, a Canadian high jumper because it worked well with the simple yet sporty aesthetic I was looking to achieve. The images are aliggned right complementing the heading on the left and the body or text in the center. Thereby forming an F as users scan through the webpage.

In terms of the colour scheme. For the page I went with traditional colours. The genereal body consited of a Black font on a contrasting white background. I did this to ensure that the website was readable. Also on the header and footer of the page, I made use of white fonts in order to contrast the black ground. 

Also I included a border for each of the headings in order to properly group relevant information together. On the webpage, it can be observed that each heading had two paragraphs, and each of the pictures of each paragraph were 250px wide. This speaks to the use of repetition to give a sense of consistency on the webpage. 

As i Stated,for this website the pictures were aligned to the right on the high.php page in order to accentuate the f-pattern layout used. On the thank you page, the text was aligned in the center because of the fact that there was not much  content on the page, so the user need not scan too much for the information on the page.

Lastly, I ensured that relevant pictures where placed in close proximity to the text, with their corresponding captions, all within a photo frame (Obtained from Professor Kostin's template.)


## Technical Coding
First of all, upon successful completion of the website, I ensured that all files were validated for CSS and html code correctness. 

Here are the database credentials I used for this page:
